I want to master coding in the next five years to work as a data scientist or software engineer.
I know that many software can help us in gaining many special skills. I have always had an interest in technology and how the system works.
Choosing a career as a software engineer gives you opportunities to work in many different industries and fields, as nearly all businesses use the software.
By gaining experience in the industry and learning how the business company works.
I can use my experience to help other companies or even in the medical field to become a better software engineer.
